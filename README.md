> Automatically generate ðŸ”¥blazingðŸ”¥ fast validators for Typescript types.

*This project is in beta but it has been tested against established libraries, like [ajv](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv), to ensure it is reliable and doesn't make mistakes.*

# Example

```typescript
type Cat<T> = {
    breed: "tabby" | "siamese";
    isNice: boolean;
    trinket?: T;
}
register('Cat')
const isNumberCat = createValidator<Cat<number>>()
isNumberCat({ breed: "tabby", isNice: false })                 // true
isNumberCat({ breed: "corgi", isNice: true, trinket: "toy" })  // false
```

# Purpose

Because Typescript types are erased at compile time you can't use them to validate data at runtime. For example, you might want to ensure an API is returning data that matches a given type at runtime. This library (macro) generates validation functions for your Typescript types at compile time.

# Why this library/macro?

## Ease of Use
With typecheck.macro you can write normal Typescript types and automatically get validation functions for them. Other validation libraries require you to write your types in a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). Thus, typecheck.macro naturally integrates into your project without requiring you to change any existing code.

typecheck.macro supports validating interfaces, generics, tuples, unions, index signatures, optional properties, and more so you can validate most of your existing types automatically.

## Performance
typecheck.macro generates specialized validation functions for each type that are pure Javascript. (Almost) every other library generates generic data structures that are plugged into a generic validator function.

typecheck.macro is up to 3x faster than [ajv](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv), the fastest JSON schema validator. And anywhere from 6 to 500 times faster than popular libraries, like [runtypes](https://github.com/pelotom/runtypes) or [zod](https://github.com/vriad/zod).

*All comparisons are friendly in nature*

# Installation
If you are using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) or [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), you can just install the macro. No other steps needed! (*Most likely, I haven't tried it personally, so let me know what happens!*)

Otherwise, you will need to switch over to compiling your Typescript with Babel. This isn't difficult since Babel has good Typescript support. See [the example](example/).

Then install `babel-plugin-macros` and add it to your babel config.

Finally, `npm install typecheck.macro`

# Usage
*In addition to reading this, read [the example](example/).*

```typescript
import createValidator, { register } from 'typecheck.macro'

type A = {index: number, name: string}
register('A')
// named type
const validator = createValidator<A>()
// anonymous type
const validator2 = createValidator<{index: number, name: string}>()
// mix and match (anonymous type that contains a named type)
const validator3 = createValidator<{index: number, value: A}>()
```

### `register(typeName: string)`
If you want to validate a named type or an anonymous type that references a named type, you must register the named type.

`typeName` is the name of the type you want to register. The type declaration must be in the same scope of the call to `register`.

```typescript
{
    type A = {val: string}
    register('A') // registers A
    {
        register('A') // does nothing :(
    }
}
register('A') // does nothing :(
```

All registered types are stored in a global namespace.

`register` automatically registers **all** types in the same scope as the original type it is registering that are referred to by the original type.

```typescript
type A = {val: string}
type B = {val: A}
type C = {val: A}
// registers A and B, but not C, since B only refers to A.
register('B')
```
All instances of the `register` macro are evaluated before any instance of `createValidator`. So ordering doesn't matter.

*Because `register` stores types in a global namespace for your entire project, make sure all your registered types have different names.*

Most of the primitive types (`string`, `number`, etc.) are already registered for you. As are `Array` and `ReadonlyArray`.

### `createValidator<T>(): (value: unknown) => value is T`
Creates a validator function for the type `T`.

`T` can be any valid supported Typescript type. This includes any named type, anonymous type, or anonymous type that has references to named types.

At compile time, the call to register will be replaced with the generated code.

# Performance Table

The numbers are nanoseconds.

In the interest of fairness, typecheck.macro (currently) does not generate error messages (this is a WIP feature). It returns a boolean value indicating whether the given object matches the type. Thus, typecheck.macro does less work than the other libraries. However, typecheck.macro should still be faster, even if it generates error messages, because it generates efficient Javascript code while the other libraries (except ajv, which is also extremely fast) do not perform code generation.

Furthermore, typecheck.macro has not had any real performance/code generation optimizations yet, so the generated code will become even faster over time.

Generate data with `pnpm run bench:prep` and run a benchmark with `pnpm run bench -- [macro|ajv|io-ts|runtypes|zod] --only=[simple|complex]` where `only` is an optional flag.

# Caveats
- typecheck.macro currently allows extra keys to pass validation. This is consistent with the behavior of type aliases in Typescript, but different from the behavior of interfaces. Disallowing extra keys is a WIP feature.
- typecheck.macro does not handle circular references
